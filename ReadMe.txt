Space Ninja 3D v 0.10

Use “j” and “k” to toggle between near and far perspectives.  Use “a” and “d” to move the Ninja left and right.

Use “space bar” to launch Ninja away from a planet. The ninja’s feet must be on the ground.   Black monoliths will take the Ninja back to the starting point.   To win your Ninja must traverse space and make it to the silver monolith positioned on the Pentagram Sun.  
Known bug - each time the Ninja re-spawns at the beginning of the level the music starts another instance, thus multiple instances of the music play. A fix is coming soon  External Assets
