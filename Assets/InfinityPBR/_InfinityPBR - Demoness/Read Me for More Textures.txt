Thank you for supporting my work!

Due to Asset Store restrictions, I wasn't able to include the humanoid texture in the download.  You can get this now by registering your purchase at my site, http://www.InfinityPBR.com

There, you can also download the bonus content, like the Substance Painter and rig source files.

I know it sucks to have to create an account and register the package, so I apologize for that.

Thank you!!
